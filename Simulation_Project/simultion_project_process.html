    <h2>Project Brief</h2>
    <div>  I began this project by examining the meaning of "Migration". Two aspects caught my attention and I chose to simulate them: firstly, the tendency to move from less favorable conditions to more advantageous settings in pursuit of greater opportunities; and secondly, the characteristic alignment in migratory movements. This brings to my mind the cycle of updating and iteration of tech products in our rapid-paced times. My aim is to depict outdated technological items in search of a new habitat for survival.

    <h2>Process and technical details</h2>
    <div> The final content consists of two parts: a proper order sequence of outdated technological items and a scene depicting a space tunnel through which these items migrate to a new world. To achieve the orderly arrangement of items, I created a prefab to replicate objects into multiple layers. Within each layer, a loop computes and establishes the position for each object. Positions are determined using trigonometric functions to ensure a semi-circular arrangement.

    <h2>Process and technical details</h2>
    <div> In the second part, I learned from tutorials on particle systems and created a space tunnel. Initially, I intended to design a track for objects to enter along, but during experimentation, I found that having multiple objects surging in closely together better depicted the characteristics of migration. Therefore, I devised this scene depicting their collective surge into the new world.
