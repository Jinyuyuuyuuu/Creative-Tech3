    <h2>Understanding the Basic Shader Structure</h2>
     For this project, I hope to start with a 3D spikeball and learn more about the possibilities of shaders by experimenting with different transformations.
     I started with a shader code that renders a rotating 3D spikeball created by “tholzer”. I tried to understand the core elements of the GLSL shader which composed with: vertex positions, color calculations, and rendering techniques like ray marching.

    <h2>Color Exploration</h2>
     After understanding the technical composition of this project, I embarked on my first exploration of changing various colors. I initially changed the background color to black for higher contrast. Since the color of the main Spikeball is determined by the Raymarching loop, I modified the color calculations based on position. Following this, I attempted to change its color to a gradient pink and added a noise texture. This noise approach overlaid a pattern onto the surface of the spikeball to create a textured effect.

    <h2>Shape Exploration</h2>
    After exploring color variations, I wanted to understand how the “spikes" or “strokes" of the spikeball function. So, I adjusted the calculations within the 'spikeball' function code and tested out how different coefficients affect the shape.

    <h2>Transformation Exploration</h2>
    Next, I worked on trying out some transformation potentials such as altering the spikeball’s shape, size, position, and even its behavior over time. These actions were appraoched by defining transform functions like rotation,or twisting, and then apply them in the distance function.
