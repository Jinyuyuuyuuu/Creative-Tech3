    <h2><div align="center">Overview</h2>
    <div> 
    In this project, I attempted to use TouchDesigner to visualize the flow of air and project it onto a real-world ventilation outlet. The final outcome consists of four parts: the central mesh acts as the main body matching the shape of the vent, particles serve as disordered floating objects, fluctuating waves represent the horizontal airflow, and the dense waves at the top signify the vertical airflow.

    <h2><div align="center">Part1-Bouncy Mesh & Particles</h2>

      <div class="paragraph-oneColumn">
    This part was refined based on a class exercise. For the main body of the “donut” shape, we applied a mesh material, and make its size scaled reacting to the music. To achieve the visual representation of airflow, we harnessed the Particle SOP to generate a base particle system, simulating the chaotic drift of particulate matter.

    <h2><div align="center">Part2-Waves</h2>

      <div class="paragraph-oneColumn">
    In this step, the approach I've taken involves employing feedback loops and noise functions to craft a compelling simulation of waves, capturing their natural rhythm and movement. Simultaneously, I apply a spectrum of color gradients and tactile textures, which inject depth and dimension into the otherwise flat waves. Furthermore, by introducing a subtle blur effect to the visual output, the waves gain a softer, more authentic quality that brings the animation closer to the fluid motion of air.

    <h2><div align="center">Part3-Vibrating lines(Top Part)</h2>

      <div class="paragraph-oneColumn">
    For this part, I mainly used Circle TOPs and a Copy TOP to take the transformed circle and replicate it multiple times, creating a series of circles that formed the bouncing line. Then, I created the particle-based animation.

    Finally, by adding the KantanMapper from the left column and drawing the shape to be projected within it. Drag the three parts into the segment, piece them together, and project them onto the aligned position of the vent.
