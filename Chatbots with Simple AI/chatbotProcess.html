    <h2>Step 1 ‚Äì Set Up</h2>
    <div> 
    In my first attempt, I learned how to create a button in Python and make it clickable. By setting 'intents.message_content = True', the bot is enabled to receive message content. Use 'button_callback' to send a message based on the click.
 <br><br>
    A notable point: Although I'm still unfamiliar with Python, I've realized its strictness regarding formatting. Unlike JavaScript, which uses semicolons for segmentation, Python's indentation is very important.

    <h2>Step 2 ‚Äì  Embed emoji in a button & delay the button response</h2>
    <div> 
    After understanding the basics of buttons, I started experimenting with different UI styles. I wanted to create a response delay similar to the sloth "Flash" from Zootopia, where it doesn't respond immediately after people click but rather 20 seconds later. I had several friends try it out, and since we're accustomed to fast information exchange, they all found it strange and pressed the button many times in succession, which was similar to the reaction I envisioned.

	await interaction.response.defer()  
	# Acknowledge the interaction first to prevent a timeout
	await asyncio.sleep(20)
	await interaction.followup.send("I am Flash")  
	# Send the message after the delay

    <h2>Step 3 ‚Äì  Extended Function‚Äì"Truth or Dare"</h2>
    <div> 
    Then I explored more uses for this interaction. I created a chat bot for "Truth or Dare" with a button to randomly pick between "Truth" or "Dare" and then generate questions accordingly.

    <h2>Step 4 ‚Äì Set Up</h2>
    <div> 
    Initially, I thought about using predetermined replies to guide the process of pulling up the calendar and helping them arrange it together. However, I decided to give it more empathetic characteristics. 
 <br><br>
    I resolved to make replies more relevant based on the user's replies, and after some research, I found out that this could be achieved by using an NLP library. I read about the principles of Tokenization but felt it was too advanced for my current skills. So, I searched for tutorials to create a keywords list and use Simple Keyword Matching to implement more relevant responses while also making it have a more patient tone.
