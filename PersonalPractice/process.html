    <h2><div align="center">Overview</h2>
    <div> 
    My interest in the technology field lies in amplifying human sensations through the combination of digital and physical experiences. Currently, my main interest is in how to enhance the relaxation experience during leisure time. To be honest, I do not have a clear favorite tool; I still hope to try various possibilities that can achieve my goals. Therefore, I have tried combining Arduino with Touch Designer, integrating Touch Designer with physical objects, and creating pure animations with Blender.

    <h2><div align="center">Part1-Motion Exploration</h2>

      <div class="paragraph-oneColumn">
    This part was refined based on a class exercise. For the main body of the “donut” shape, we applied a mesh material, and make its size scaled reacting to the music. To achieve the visual representation of airflow, we harnessed the Particle SOP to generate a base particle system, simulating the chaotic drift of particulate matter.

    <h2><div align="center">Part2-Analyze Texture</h2>

      <div class="paragraph-oneColumn">
    The stone, an element ubiquitous in nature, caught my attention due to its uniqueness—each stone possesses a distinct touch, texture, and shape, allowing people to understand a stone through visual, tactile, and sensory aspects. The irregular flow in its patterns made me envision its healing feature, leading me to wonder if transforming this flow into actual dynamics would result in a visually pleasing experience. Therefore, I set out to find special stones in the wild, primarily picking them up during my hikes. By obtaining and resampling parameters from the stone's texture, I transformed them into a set of data, as if recording the unique story of each stone.

    <h2><div align="center">Part3-Deformation Attempts</h2>
      <img src="organic.gif" width="800">
      <div class="paragraph-oneColumn">
    Next, I tried to alter the shape through data to endow it with a more organic dynamic. The outcome wasn't entirely as I had expected; it looked less like a stone and more like a new creature.

<h2><div align="center">Part4-Build Shape</h2>
      <img src="buildShape.png" width="800">
      <div class="paragraph-oneColumn">
    Thus, I decided to define a soft shape for it and confine the dynamics within this form. I used a combination of metaballs to determine this pebble-like deformed shape. However, adding a UV map to this irregular shape also became one of my challenges.

    <h2><div align="center">Part5-Fluid Effect</h2>
      <img src="round.gif" width="800">
      <div class="paragraph-oneColumn">
    Since the flowing effect was difficult to achieve within the special shape I had set, I decided to create a sphere and experimented with it first. This effect of blending fluid into the stone's texture was satisfactory to me, and I hope to continue this visual experience that combines these two natural elements.

<h2><div align="center">Part6-Extend the Data to Sound Attempt</h2>
      
      <div class="paragraph-oneColumn">
    The series of experiments with stone textures has sparked some reflections. Designers have always been attempting to visualize intangible content using tangible visual elements. I wondered if it might be possible to do the opposite: transforming tangible textures into abstract sounds. In TouchDesigner, it can be converted into a type of sound wave similar to white noise. (Maxim recommended using Ableton Live for sound processing, hope I am able to explore it further) Therefore, I first attempted to set this sound wave to modulate the size of the deformation, allowing each stone to produce deformations of different frequencies and intensities according to its own patterns, akin to having a unique heartbeat.
