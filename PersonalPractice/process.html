    My interest in the technology field lies in amplifying human sensations through the combination of digital and physical experiences. Currently, my main interest is in how to enhance the relaxation experience during leisure time. To be honest, I do not have a clear favorite tool; I still hope to try various possibilities that can achieve my goals. Therefore, I have tried combining Arduino with Touch Designer, integrating Touch Designer with physical objects, and creating pure animations with Blender.

    This part was refined based on a class exercise. For the main body of the “donut” shape, we applied a mesh material, and make its size scaled reacting to the music. To achieve the visual representation of airflow, we harnessed the Particle SOP to generate a base particle system, simulating the chaotic drift of particulate matter.
